* Simple HTTP Server
  This server is used for the [[https://github.com/SilverSailors/SailingBoat][Sailingboat Application]], but not really
  used by it, it only reads logs from it.

  And it uses HTTP requests as a means of delivering JSON data to a
  log website.

  it can handle POST requests as well in order to update a destination
  file, therefore it can easy get a new location even if the user is
  not close to the sailboat.

  Additionally, it can receive a DELETE request which will delete the
  current content inside whatever file is the requested target, it's
  simply a matter of adding the name of the file and it will be
  deleted.
